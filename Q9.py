# 9. Alex is standing at the ATM to withdraw some cash. ATM will only accept the transaction 
# if the amount Alex is trying to withdraw is a multiple of $5, and his account balance has enough 
# cash for the transaction (including the transaction fee). If there is not enough cash balance 
# in the account to complete the transaction, it does not perform the withdrawal transaction. 
# For each successful withdrawal, there is a transaction fee of $1. Write a program that input 
# two integers (amount Alex wishes to withdraw, initial account balance) and prints out Alex’s 
# account balance after an attempted transaction. [2 points] 
# * Account balance never goes to negative value. 
# * Withdrawal amount of $0 is not considered. 

# Input: integer
# Output: integer
